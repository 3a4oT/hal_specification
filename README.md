# HAL - Hypertext Application Language

## A lean hypermedia type

HAL is a simple way of linking with JSON or XML.

It provides a small set of conventions on top of JSON and XML for
expressing hyperlinks to, and embeddedness of, related resources.

The spec is here: [hal\_specification.md][1].

For a friendlier, more pracitcal introduction to HAL you can read this
article: [JSON Linking with HAL][2].

The JSON variant of HAL (application/hal+json) has now been published as
an internet draft:
[draft-kelly-json-hal][5].

## Discussion Group

If you have any questions or feedback about HAL, you can message the
